  * Duties included: 	                                                             
    - Extended Soufflé Datalog engine with semantics(evidence and query) as a high-performance alternative to Problog using C++.
    - Implemented Marginal Probability Computations in Soufflé.
    - Integrated Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD) into Soufflé for Weighted Model Counting (WMC); optimized Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) variable orderings for efficiency.
    - Built benchmarks(webkb dataset) and evaluated performance against existing Problog implementations on multiple datasets.
    - Plan to support approximation computation.
    - Co-first author on a paper in preparation for CAV 2026; collaborator on a paper in preparation for PLDI 2026.
