This is Jiahao Xia's personal website. I'm currently a sophomore at Univeristy of Maryland. I'm planning to post some technical blogs and future publications on this website to record my passion.

I am doing some works on Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) this summer. You can find my summer report [here](/files/ReportCAV.pdf).
